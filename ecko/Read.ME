
## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download** the project files to your local machine.

2. **Replace placeholder content** with your actual content:
   - Update the photographer's name in the logo and headings
   - Replace Unsplash image URLs with your own photography
   - Update the About section text with your actual bio
   - Update contact information (email, phone, social media links)

3. **Customize the design** if needed:
   - Modify colors in the `:root` CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`
   - Update fonts in the Google Fonts link and CSS variables
   - Adjust layout breakpoints in the media queries

4. **Deploy the website**:
   - Upload all three files to your web hosting service
   - Ensure the files are in the same directory
   - The site is ready to use with no build process required

## Image Optimization Notes

- The portfolio uses responsive images with `srcset` attributes
- Images are lazy-loaded using the Intersection Observer API
- Hero images are loaded eagerly for immediate display
- Consider compressing images before uploading for better performance

## Browser Support

The website supports all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and includes fallbacks for older browsers where possible.

## Performance Considerations

- All CSS is in one file to minimize HTTP requests
- JavaScript is modular and only loaded when needed
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts CDN with `preload` hint
- Images are served in modern formats where possible

## License
